                        kernel
--------------------------------------------------------
kernel is the package that contains the linux kernel and
initial ramdisk. they are located in the boot directory,
under the names vmlinuz-<version> and
initrd.img-<version>. They are loaded by GRUB on boot,
and after the kernel does some initialization, it
launches the first userland process (pid=1), /sbin/init.
The kernel provides services to the userland programs,
that can be accessed with interrupt 80h.
