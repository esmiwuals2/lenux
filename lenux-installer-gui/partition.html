    <h1>Create a partition</h1>
    <p>A partition is like a slice of a disk, dedicated to a certain task. Each partition can be formatted however you like. For example, the Windows C: drive is a partition of type NTFS.</p>
    <p>A partition must be created to contain your Lenux system. It will be of type EXT4.</p>
    <p>This will be created using a utility called GParted. It is very simple to use, and always warns you if your actions will be harmful or destructive.</p>
