               clear
------------------------------------
Running the clear command allows
you to clear the terminal (physical
or virtual) and return the cursor
home (the top-left of the screen).
It does this by sending the
appropriate ANSI escape codes to the
terminal. Please note that your
must support this feature in order
for it to function. A traditional
teletype that uses paper obviously
cannot erase characters. It is
possible, however, to "clear" the
screen by printing many line feeds
to the terminal to move all text
off the screen.
